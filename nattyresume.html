My motivation is weakness, when I don’t understand, I simply ask. When I want to know something new I seek answers, when I need results, I generate a formula to produce the best after effect. I consider myself a forward thinker, I look to the future when I calculate my present locus. I strive to leave my mark in the future, so it’s only right I involve myself in the tech world, I recognize that technology is going to be inevitable in our existence; and I plan on coding my say in it.<br>
Starting as a wide eyed ambitious intern at Microsoft, on the windows device team to being offered a position as a software test engineer on the surface team shortly after share interchangeable mannerism that I possess. I come equipped with a balance of confidence and empathy, a strong community leader I feel  should have a high IQ with higher emotional intelligence, with my balance of both I strive to become a technical program manager in the future, below you will learn why I am a strong qualifier.</p>
